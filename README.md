### Journal Entries - Git O'reilly Textbook

May 28th, 2024 - Chapters 1 and 2 (Week 1 Journal)

- I've used the basic git commands before and have collaborated on projects with others using git for version control as well. 
The chapters were mostly a review but I enjoyed the visualizations and the 'why?' behind the structure of git. 
For example, the explanation of local repositories and their staging area and commit history.

June 10th, 2024 - Git Linux Command Line (Week 2 Journal)

- makefile is something that I have never done before. It was convenient and relatively simple how a single script could me made
to automate making multiple files. The format of naming each block in the script after the intended file name made for easy organization
and readable code. Navigating through the txt files with wget and local directory with only the command line took some getting used to, but 
it got easier the more I played around with being at different locations in the current working directory (pwd). This is where I found the reading 
most helpful, learning the commands that help navigate the directory via the shell and to find text that matches certain cases.

June 10th, 2024 - Python Marking/Cleaning Text and Logging (Week 3 Journal)

- This week 3 reading was mostly a review for me on how to use python functions to manipulate strings and search text for occurrences, counts of words or events.
What was new to me was how to log a file. It does make sense that to store all the logging messages it might be best to place them in a file to not lose track.
It seems like an ideal way to monitor usage and flag for errors that can be recorded in logs to later reference for debugging. 

June 17th, 2024 - Python tests

- For week 4 we went over the assert functions used in python tests functions and how pytest package is used to run test py scripts. 
This section was mostly a review since knew pytest and how to use assert function. What I did find helpful is how to modify pytest command 
to run only subtests of test.py if that's the only test I'm focused on testing/debugging code.

July 7th, 2024 - Github Workflow Automation

- For week 5 we went over github actions workflow via yaml files. I've ran github actions before but haven't created one from scratch. I know that developrs sometimes use these features to deploy and test code pipelines that might not be used for production but for analytics and tracking. The structure of worflow actions starts with the triggers named events. Components are jobs that have defined steps with runners deciding where the code will execute. I plan to catch up this week on the labs and quizzes I missed last week, and confirm I am setting up repo correctly for grading in office hours.

July 8th, 2024 - Creating python packages

- For week 6 we went over how to setup init.py, setup.py and a repo to make a pip installable package for python. I have had experience with making packages and virtual environments so this section was review.
